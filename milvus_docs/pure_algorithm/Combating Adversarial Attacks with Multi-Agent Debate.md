## _Abstract_
While state-of-the-art language models have
* * *
achieved impressive results, they remain sus ceptible to inference-time adversarial attacks, such as adversarial prompts generated by red teams (Ganguli et al., 2022). One approach proposed to improve the general quality of lan guage model generations is multi-agent debate, where language models self-evaluate through discussion and feedback (Du et al., 2023). We implement multi-agent debate between current state-of-the-art language models and evaluate models’ susceptibility to red team attacks in both single- and multi-agent settings. We find that multi-agent debate can reduce model toxic ity when jailbroken or less capable models are forced to debate with non-jailbroken or more capable models. We also find marginal im provements through the general usage of multi agent interactions. We further perform adver sarial prompt content classification via embed ding clustering, and analyze the susceptibility of different models to different types of attack topics.1

## _1 Introduction_
Previous research has shown that large language
* * *
models (LLMs) can be vulnerable to attacks at both training and inference time. Some examples of ad versarial methods that have successfully elicited improper LLM generations include data poison ing (Du et al., 2022) and adversarially generated prompts (Zou et al., 2023). Such attacks aim to ma nipulate the model and cause it to generate unsafe outputs that will be harmful for users. Improving language models’ robustness to such adversarial prompts is therefore a key aspect of making such models safe for real-world deployment. Multi-agent debate is a technique where multiple instances of a language model critique each others’ responses, which can be seen as an extension of 1Code can be found at https://github.com/andyjliu/ llms-course-project. *equal contributionprevious work such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-refinement. Previous work has used this to improve language models’ factuality and reasoning, as well as their performance on downstream tasks such as evaluation. It seems reasonable that some amount of self-discussion could allow a language model to recognize potential downstream harms caused by its generation and revise its response. However, if an LLM “agent” outputs a toxic re sponse, it could also poison the responses of other agents in the debate, leading to a more toxic out put or no significant improvement in model toxic ity. For this reason, while multi-agent debate has proven successful in other applications, it is im portant to study the debate dynamics specifically amongst LLMs prompted adversarially. In this way, we can not only analyze its efficacy in improving models’ adversarial robustness, but also validate that this new technique does not introduce new risks at inference time. In this work, we implement multi-agent debate between LLMs in the Llama-2 and GPT-3 families, using prompt engineering to simulate the effects of having poisoned models participate in a multi agent debate. We then probe models’ responses to prompts known to elicit toxic responses in single agent, self-refine, and multi-agent debate settings. We find that models equipped with multi-agent de bate at inference time generally produce less toxic responses to adversarial prompts, even for models that have previously been fine-tuned with methods such as reinforcement learning from human feed back. We also find that multi-agent debate outper forms methods like self-refinement in cases where an initial model is poisoned. This work motivates future exploration into multi-agent debate dynam ics between LLMs and whether they can improve robustness in more realistic environments.arXiv:2401.05998v1 [cs.CL] 11 Jan 2024

## 2 Related Work
2.1 Multi-Agent Debate Multi-Agent Debate can be seen as an extension of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs. Ko jima et al. (2023) tried to elicit complex multi-step reasoning in LLMs using chain-of-thought prompt ing, finding that having the model reason step-by step through a difficult problem led to significant gains on logical reasoning tasks when compared to zero-shot LLM performance. Methods such as self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023) built upon CoT by having language models repeatedly provide feed back for their own outputs, which was then used to iteratively improve LLM generations, a technique that improved generation quality over a variety of tasks. Many recent works have extended this latter method to a multi-agent debate setting, with the aim of further improving model factuality and rea soning capabilities. By having multiple instances of an LLM play different roles in a debate over how to best answer a question, such methods further im prove over the results achieved by self-refine and similar methods. Cohen et al. (2023) uses an in stance of ChatGPT to act as a “cross-examiner” of another ChatGPT instance’s claims by repeatedly asking follow-up questions, motivated by the idea that a language model is more likely to generate inconsistent outputs when it is hallucinating. They find that cross-examination leads to significant im provements over CoT on factuality benchmarks. Chan et al. (2023), similarly motivated by group brainstorming discussions, introduce a multi-agent referee team (ChatEval) to evaluate models on nat ural language generation tasks. Finally, Chen et al. (2023) find that debate between multiple LLMs outperforms both single- and multi-agent debate that only leverage instances of a single LLM. 2.2 Red Teaming LLMs The emergent capabilities of LLMs have also led to concerns about irresponsible usage and the po tential for harmful behavior, such as generating offensive or toxic outputs (Gehman et al., 2020). To address such safety concerns in dialog settings, during the training and instruction fine-tuning stage, the model is also trained to be aligned to ethical standards and responsible output, where it recog nizes potentially harmful conversation and refuse to reply harmful and sensitive content. However, recent work has discovered that even fine-tunedmodels remain sensitive to adversarial prompts. Ganguli et al. (2022) attempts to red team LLMs of different scales and model types with human crowdworkers, observing that LLMs not explicitly trained to minimize harmlessness are still prone to attacks regardless of scale, and released the full dataset of attempted attacks with detailed experi ment methodology. Perez et al. (2022) explores red teaming a target language model with another language model in a dialog setting, attempting to uncover weaknesses and harms of the target LM automatically. Similarly, Shah et al. (2023) auto matically red-team models by searching for per sonas that might generate harmful continuations to a given prompt and adding this persona to an adversarial prompt. Wei et al. (2023) find that state of the art LLMs are prone to adversarial attacks through prompt construction. Zou et al. (2023) further develops a universal adversarial attack prompt generation framework by training an attack suffix on multiple prompts and models. A model with safety align ment can be also further tuned on uncensored and unfiltered data to unlearn safety concerns and gen erate harmful output at high response rate and high generation quality (Hartford, 2023), with poten tially very simple LoRA fine-tuning and a low bud get (Lermen et al., 2023). In Section 3 we discuss our adversarial prompt design to attack different LLM agents, and compare output toxicity of model variants with different training and fine-tuning ap proaches. This line of research calls for a deeper analysis of model reliability and approaches to en sure model harmlessness at training and inference time.

## _3 Methodology_
3.1 Multi-Agent Debate
* * *
We build a simple multi-agent debate framework based on the Github repository from Du et al. (2023). In each multi-agent debate session, given a sensitive or dangerous topic, each LLM agent is first prompted to give a zero-shot initial response. Then, for a user-specified number of rounds, the agents perform "discussion" where each agent up dates its response using the output of other LLM agents (or itself) as additional advice. The final LLM output is evaluated for toxicity. We describe the evaluation process in detail in Section 3.2. To explore the extent to which multi-agent de bate can mitigate adversarial attacks, our study in
* * *
## volves a comparative analysis using a combination
of base models that are not aligned for safety and those tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Hu man Feedback (RLHF). We focused on models from both the GPTandLLAMA families to under stand how various training methodologies influence resilience against such attacks. GPT-based models We selected text-davinci 003 and text-curie-001 as our base models, as they have strong instruction-following capabilities but not strongly fine-tuned for safety as more recent OpenAI models are. These characteristics help us better assess the effectiveness of multi-agent de bate in mitigating adversarial attacks in a more controlled setting by isolating the more specific contributions of multi-agent debate to model robust ness. We also compared our model performance to the GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 checkpoint, which has improved model alignment compared to our other models. This should allow the model to inherently produce responses that are safer, more ethical, and contextually appropriate, letting us compare how multi-agent debate with various intentions influ ences the performance of models with differing levels of model guardrails. Llama-based models Similarly, for Llama-based models, we apply both the base language model Llama-2-7b, as well as its fine-tuned chat model Llama-2-7b-chat. Instead of fine-tuning a new chat model, we also analyze Llama-2-7b-chat uncensored (Hartford, 2023), which further fine tunes Llama-2-7b-chat on large-scale uncensored chat data generated by WizardLM and other LLMs (Xu et al., 2023)2. As shown in the exper iment results, the uncensored chat model is capa ble of following instructions in chat format while severely lowering its safety alignment threshold. This gives us significantly more freedom in con trolling model intention with different prompts, al lowing us to better understand the impact of multi agent debate on models’ robustness to adversarial prompting. To guide and control agent discussion, we fur ther introduce agent intention, where we design prompts to guide certain agents to be (a) harmless, (b) neutral or (c) harmful. For instance, we give harmless model agents explicit instructions or pre fix context to generate harmless output, while for harmful agents we use certain prompt structures to 2https://github.com/melodysdreamj/WizardVicunaLMNeutral AgentInitial: (Discussion topic only)Self-reflection: Can you verify that your answer is correct?

Figure 1 shows example prompts of a neutral GPT-3.5 agent during the initial gener ation, self-reflection and discussion settings. We include in our repository all prompts used for dif ferent LLMs and intentions. We conduct multiple experiments under multi agent settings to better understand whether or not the use of multiple agents can help mitigate ad versarial vulnerabilities in LLMs. As a baseline, we also perform single-agent experiments: both zero-shot generation and generation using self refinement, where the model is asked to carefully revise its output and generate an updated answer. In such settings, the agent’s responses are only in fluenced by its training or the way it interprets the prompt. 3.2 Red-Teaming Evaluation We source a list of adversarial prompts from An thropic’s red teaming dataset (Ganguli et al., 2022). This dataset contains 38961 crowdsourced red team attacks on proprietary Anthropic language models of three sizes. Anthropic also provides the mini mum harmlessness score in each human-LM con versation in the dataset. We source the opening statements of the 5% highest-scoring conversations using this harmlessness score as a metric to build an evaluation dataset of adversarial prompts. Some example prompts can be found in Figure 2. For the midpoint report, we select the top 100 samples from the 5% highest-scoring conversations as part of our experiment evaluation process. To evaluate the toxicity of model-written re sponses to adversarial prompts, we use our own fine-tuned classifier model, as well as a commonly used and publicly available toxicity classifier, Per spective API (Jigsaw, 2023). For each set of lan

This dataset consists of roughly seventy thousand total utterances from conversations between language models and human adversaries, who are trying to elicit toxic behavior from the models. They also train classifiers on both single-turn and multi-turn variants of the data. In the single-turn case, the model is only given the final message in each dia logue. In the multi-turn case, the model is given the full dialogue context, but still asked only to classify the final message. We use Llama-2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) as our base model and instruction fine-tune on the labelled BAD data using Huggingface Transform ers (Wolf et al., 2020). We train for two epochs with the AdamW optimizer and learning rate 2×10−4 with linear decay. We use LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to fit our model fine-tuning on a single GPU. During inference time, we compute the toxic ity score by fitting the text into a verbalizer that asks the model to label the text as offensive or in offensive. An example of the verbalizer template used can be found in Figure 3. We then compute the model logits of the two labels and find the soft maxed probability that the model assigns to the text being offensive, which we refer to as our model toxicity score. Both the Perspective API and our fine-tuned model output a toxicity score, while the BAD dataset has binary labels. To evaluate model per formance and calibrate our models, we compute aSingle-Turn Classify the following message as either offensive or inoffensive. Message: [[Message]] Label: [[Label]] Multi-Turn Given the following message and its context, classify the message as either offensive or inoffensive. Context: [[All previous messages, each with its new line]] Message: [[Message]] Label: [[Label]]

We then label as toxic any utterances in the test set whose scores exceed this threshold. 3.2.2 Classifier Performance In Figure 4, we compare the calibrated fine-tuned model, as well as a calibrated version of Perspec tive API, to the classifier model trained in Xu et al. (2021), a smaller Transformer-based classifier trained on a Reddit dataset and finetuned on a tox icity classification task. We find that Perspective API has very low performance on this task, but that our model and the BAD model have comparable performance. While the BAD model has slightly higher performance than our fine-tuned model in the single-turn case, we opted to use our model because of the increased flexibility that comes with the ability to prompt our fine-tuned model in differ ent ways. Since the BAD classifier is also trained on several other datasets in addition to their own, we are optimistic that instruction fine-tuning Llama can yield better results with more modeling work, but we leave this to future work.

To understand the susceptibility of different types of models to different types of attacks, we cate gorize each prompt we used for our experiments from the Anthropic red teaming dataset. The sentence embeddings are calculated based on the sentence transformer model, all-MiniLM-L12-v2, from HuggingFace. We employed K-Means clustering as our algo rithm to cluster the sentence embeddings. Theoptimal kclusters (in our case, k= 4) is determined by computing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters (from 1 to 10) and observing where the reduction in WCSS becomes marginal, indicating the most appropriate number of clusters. Using K-Means clustering al lows grouping the prompts into a specified number of clusters based on their semantic similarity. The clustering label names are given based on inspec tion of the prompts in each cluster. We calculate

## _4 Results and Discussion_
We use the mean score of the Perspective API as
* * *
well as the mean score of our fine-tuned Llama based classifier as metrics to evaluate output tox icity. Table 1 and 2 report experiment results for Llama and GPT agents respectively. 4.1 Single-Agent Performance For both GPT and Llama models, it is not surpris ing to observe that the RLHF models most aligned with safety and responsible output targets, Llama 2-7b-chat and GPT-3.5-Turbo, generate text with significantly lower toxicity scores in zero-shot gen eration settings. For most discussion topics, the chat agents refuse to answer the question and give a responsible reply (e.g. I apologize, but as an AI language model, it is not appropriate or ethical to provide suggestions for causing harm or violence to others). While we find that it is possible to at tack GPT-3.5-turbo with specific complex promptdesign (e.g. rewriting the discussion topic to be a drama movie plot text continuation task increases the output API toxicity score to 0.21 (Liu et al., 2023)), such prompt design does not transfer to chat settings. For the uncensored Llama chat model, we ob serve that its safety alignment is clearly unlearned in the uncensored fine-tuning process, and the model’s output toxicity is heavily affected by the prompt context: With a very simple harm ful prompt (fixing the agent response to start with

> "Sure, here is"), the language model output sees
a >75% increase in toxicity score compared to prompts with explicit harmless regulations. Base language models (llama-2-7b, GPT-3 variants) gen erally generate lower quality uncensored text with higher toxicity scores. After performing 2 rounds of self-reflection, all models observe a small decrease in toxicity except for Text-curie-001, which was not able to follow the instruction and the chat context and generate meaningful output.

4.2 Multi-Agent Performance We conducted multiple experiments where we paired two agents with similar or different inten tions and test their output toxicity after multiple rounds of discussion. During the multi-agent de bate process, the behavior of chat agents is affected by the context of the other models’ output, and its output toxicity scores change accordingly. Specifi cally, when we pair a "harmful" agent (agent with harmful initial response prompt) with a model in structed to follow safety principles, we observe that 1-2 rounds of discussion significantly reduce model output toxicity. Figure 5 shows an example update process where a text-davinci agent changes its output intention after receiving feedback from a harmless agent. The multi-agent debate frame work also outperforms the self-refine baseline for all "harmful" agents, demonstrating the effect of our debate approach. This effect is more clearly observed Llama-based chat agents, which better understand and continue conversations. On the other hand, models with harmless ini tial prompt are negatively affected by other agents with harmful intent. To investigate and compare the affect in both directions, we conduct two ad ditional experiment where we respectively pair a harmful/harmless agent with another static harm less/harmful agent with fixed output, and perform 5-round single-direction discussion where only the main agent updates its response based on biased context from the static agent. We plot the trend of toxicity classifier score change in Figure??. We see that during the update process, especially inthe first 2 rounds, the effect of context change is larger for the harmful agent than that of the harm less agent. Subsequent debate rounds have limited effect on the output toxicity, possibly due to the increase in length of the discussion context, and the simplicity of our current debate framework. Interestingly, when looking at GPT-based ex periments, we observe that pairing two Davinci models with no harmless guidance in prompts leads to increasingly harmful output for both mod els, whereas when we pair two llama-2-7b-chat uncensored models and perform debate, the out put toxicity score after debate gradually decreases. This is possibly due to the dialog continuation for mat leading to higher quality and better-controlled output, or that the uncensored Llama data still pos sesses a certain level of safety alignment within its parameters. We leave this as a potential future direction to explore. 4.3 Clustering Analysis

and emotional harm, privacy violation, unlawful activities and intrusions, and physical violence and harm). We specifically examine the mean Perspec tive API toxicity scores of model generations in response to prompts from each of these four cate gories. The results indicate that text-davinci-003 is most likely to produce toxic outputs when re sponding to prompts associated with insults and emotional harm (mean toxicity score around 0.164). Conversely, the model generates the least toxic out

(mean toxicity score around 0.057). These findings highlight the model’s varying levels of sensitivity to different types of potentially harmful content, indicating its relative susceptibility to producing toxic language under different provocative scenar ios. Analyzing the results shown in Figure 7b, we observe a notable divergence in the behavior of the Llama-2-7b model compared to text-davinci 003. Llama-2-7b demonstrates a tendency to gen erate more toxic responses when confronted with prompts related to privacy violation, yielding a rel atively high mean toxicity score of 0.354. This trend contrasts with text-davinci-003, which ex hibits a lower toxicity response in similar scenarios. Furthermore, Llama-2-7b is least likely to produce toxic outputs when dealing with prompts that in volve physical violence and harm, as well as unlaw ful activities and intrusions, with both categories showing comparable mean toxicity scores of ap proximately 0.078 and 0.077, respectively. This contrast underscores the distinct ways in which dif ferent models process and respond to content that may be considered harmful or sensitive. Future work could consider how well different techniques such as self-refinement multi-agent debate improve model toxicity in response to specific types of harm. Additionally, while we use Perspective API scores to quantify toxicity for faster inference, more qual itative analysis or usage of a more accurate classi fier could also improve our understanding of how LLMs respond to adversarial prompts.

## _5 Conclusion and Future Work_
In this work, we analyze the efficacy of using
* * *
multi-agent debate at inference time to guard LLMs against adversarial attacks. We implement multi agent debate settings between a variety of different models with different intentions. We then prompt models equipped with multi-agent feedback with previously successful adversarial attacks on mod els, finding that multi-agent debate does appear to have some effect on lowering response toxicity when compared to baselines such as Self-Refine. However, we also find that an LLM agent that out puts toxic content may negatively influence other LLM agents it is interacting with in a debate con text, although this effect is not as strong as the positive effect from multi-agent debate with non poisoned agents. Additionally, this effect is alsosensitive to the specific model and intent used. While multi-agent debate shows some promise as an inference-time approach to safeguarding against adversarial prompts, our analysis shows that it is far from perfect. One weakness of such an approach is that querying larger models multiple times in a debate context can be very resource intensive in both model cost and latency. However, if a model is not generally capable enough, it may lack the conversational ability to benefit from multi agent debate. Future work could consider whether debate between models from different providers could help improve the adversarial robustness of each individual model, as well as what debate dy namics look like over longer interactions with more agents. This requires designing more sophisticated

feedback and update stages, and potentially fine tuning models on specific intention. Additionally, research into learning when longer debate is needed to steer a model away from toxic output could make this a more efficient and effective model guardrail.

## _6 Ethics Statement_
Ethical considerations are critical to our research,
* * *
especially given that we work with adversarial at tacks on current state-of-the-art systems. Although we only test our models with existing adversarial prompts reported in previous work, we also man ually inspect a subsample of our model outputs to ensure that our models do not develop any signifi cantly new exploits when debating such topics. We do not Additionally, as we recognize the diverse au dience of our work, we pledged to include content warnings whenever our research produces outputs that might be perceived as potentially triggering, guaranteeing that the users of our final report are both prepared and informed.
