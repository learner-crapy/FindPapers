ternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi agent debate and meta-judging to enhance eval uation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains under explored. In this study, we conduct a system atic analysis of four diverse bias types: posi tion bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM as-Judge frameworks:Multi-Agent-Debateand LLM-as-Meta-Judge.Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater re sistance.We further investigate the incorpora tion of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these sys tems.The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate set tings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios.Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as Judge systems and highlights the need for tar geted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.

As task complexity grows, generat ing the massive amounts of labeled data required through human effort alone has become imprac tical. To address this bottleneck, recent research has explored using LLMs themselves as sources of supervision. Notably, Burns et al. observed that su pervision from weaker models has potential to help elicit the capabilities of stronger models. These findings have further motivated the shift toward au tomated, scalable feedback mechanisms that reduce reliance on costly human annotation. Within this line of work, the LLM-as-Judge paradigm (Chan et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025b; Saha et al., 2025), which uses LLMsarXiv:2505.19477v3 [cs.AI] 17 Sep 2025

## to automatically evaluate responses and provide
reward signals, has attracted particular interest due to its adaptability to custom evaluation criteria and its ability to generate human-understandable expla nations of decisions. Building upon this paradigm, recent efforts have begun to investigate whether incorporating multi agent frameworks—which have proven effective in complex reasoning tasks (Liang et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023)—can further enhance the capabilities of LLM-as-Judge pipelines. Structures such as multi agent debate (Chan et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c) and meta-reasoning (Wu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025b) offer promising avenues for boost ing evaluation quality. Despite these advances, concerns remain. Several studies reveal that even single-agent LLM judges have been shown to ex hibit intrinsic biases, including position bias and verbosity bias, which can undermine the reliabil ity of their evaluations (Huang et al., 2023b; Shi et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024). However, there has been limited focused or systematic investigation into whether such biases persist, diminish, or are amplified in multi-agent settings. In response to these concerns, this study system atically examines how intrinsic biases manifest in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems. As demon strated in Figure 1, we investigate two widely adopted paradigms: LLM-as-Judge withMulti Agent-DebateandLLM-as-Meta-Judge. For each paradigm, we also evaluate the performance of dif ferent LLMs as base evaluators. Our analysis fo cuses on four diverse types of bias: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought (CoT) bias, and bandwagon bias, ensuring a comprehensive exami nation across key dimensions of judgment behav ior. Interestingly, our results show that intrinsic bi ases manifest differently across the two multi-agent frameworks.The Multi-Agent-Debate frame work amplifies biases sharply after the initial de bate, and this increased bias is sustained in sub sequent rounds. In contrast, the LLM-as-Meta Judge approach exhibits greater resistance to these intrinsic biases.When the meta-judge se lects the best judgment from a set of candidates, the resulting bias levels are comparable to those ob served in single-agent settings. However, when the meta-judge generates a new judgment based on the candidate judgments, a more substantial reduction in bias is achieved. Additionally, we examine whether a leadingsingle-agent bias mitigation strategy can be effec tively extended to improve evaluation reliability in more complex multi-agent settings, particularly when direct modifications to the judge model and its prompt are impractical or undesirable. To this end, we incorporate PINE (Wang et al., 2024b), a method shown to eliminate position bias through modifications to position embeddings and causal masking, as abias-freeagent within a multi-agent LLM-as-Judge system.Our results show that introducing abias-freeagent into the debate setting yields consistent improvements as the number of conversation rounds increases. In contrast, its effect in the meta-judge framework remains limited, regardless of whether the meta judge selects an existing judgment or generates its own.These findings underscore the importance of accounting for bias dynamics in multi-agent eval uation and highlight the need for mitigation strate gies specifically tailored to collaborative decision making settings.

## _2 Related Work_
2.1 LLM-as-Judges
* * *
Recent advances in automated model evaluation have established LLMs as viable alternatives to human annotators. Zheng et al. introduced the con cept of LLM-as-Judge through MT-Bench, which evaluates alignment between LLM-generated judg ments and human preferences on open-ended ques tions. This line of research has since expanded with benchmarks such as RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) and JudgeBench (Tan et al., 2024), which as sess model alignment on more complex, reasoning intensive tasks. In parallel, researchers have ex plored improved prompting strategies (Stahl et al., 2024; Dubois et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025). Be yond prompting, fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets has been proposed to improve evaluation performance and mitigate biases (Zhu et al., 2023; Park et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Ye et al., 2025). Most recently, EvalPlanner (Saha et al., 2025) intro duced a planning-then-judging framework that in corporates agentic structure into the LLM-as-Judge paradigm. 2.2 Multi-Agent LLM-as-Judges Framework Motivated by the effectiveness of multi-agent sys tems in complex reasoning tasks (Liang et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024c; Zhang et al.,

## 2025c), recent studies have applied multi-agent ap-
proaches to LLM-based evaluation. Multi-agent debate has emerged as a popular technique, with studies such as employing structured interactions among groups of LLM juries to reach consensus (Xu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Verga et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b). In particular, ChatEval (Chan et al., 2023) aimed to more closely mirror the hu man evaluation process by facilitating structured debates among agents with diverse roles. In its setup, “general public” agents provided initial judg ments, engaged in discussions, and delivered final verdicts, while “referee” agents acted as critics or experts to challenge and refine the reasoning pro cess. Building on this design, our work adopts a similar structure in which judge agents interact with a designated critic who offers counterpoints intended to improve the quality of final decisions. In parallel, meta-thinking has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing LLM-as-Judge systems (Shinn et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024; Sui et al., 2025; Wan et al., 2025). Meta-thinking, often described as “thinking about thinking,” involves re flecting on and evaluating the reasoning process itself. The concept of a meta-judge was first in troduced by Wu et al., where it served as a self reward model during post-training. Moreover, Self Rationalization (Trivedi et al., 2024) proposed an iterative fine-tuning approach in which the judge improves by comparing and refining its own ra tionales. More recently, Li et al. expanded this idea by assigning different LLMs to act as judges and a meta-judge, facilitating collaborative evalu ation across diverse models. Our work adopts a similar design with two modes: the meta-judge ei ther selects the best judgment from multiple judges or generates a new judgment generated from their outputs. 2.3 Intrinsic Biases and Mitigation LLMs have been shown to exhibit a variety of in trinsic biases, including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, bandwagon bias, and chain-of-thought bias. These biases have been iden tified through large-scale evaluations and bench mark studies (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Ye et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024; Bao et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Gulati et al., 2025). More recently, CALM (Ye et al., 2024) evaluated twelve types of biases in single-agent LLMs using carefully designed exper iments. Our study closely follows the bias evalua-tion procedures introduced by Ye et al.. However, there is limited understanding of how these biases behave in multi-agent settings. While Wu et al. observed that certain biases may intensify during iterative training, Li et al. found that collaborative interactions among agents can reduce specific bi ases such as position and self-enhancement. These contrasting observations highlight a critical gap in understanding bias dynamics in collaborative con texts, a gap our study seeks to address. Among the various biases, position bias has re ceived particular attention due to its substantial impact across a wide range of tasks. Mitigation strategies to date have included data augmentation combined with fine-tuning (Zhu et al., 2023; Park et al., 2024) and prompt alignment techniques (Li et al., 2023b). More recently, the PINE frame work (Wang et al., 2024b) was introduced to com pletely eliminate position bias by modifying causal masking and positional embeddings. While these methods have demonstrated strong performance, their effectiveness in multi-agent contexts remains largely unexplored. Our work seeks to fill this gap by leveraging PINE as abias-freeagent to assess its impact on position bias in collaborative evaluation scenarios. This is particularly important in settings where modifying the prompts or internal structure of judge models is impractical or undesirable.

## _3 Method_
3.1 Evaluative Settings
* * *
In this study, we adopt the score-based pairwise comparison setting to stick with that of ChatEval (Chan et al., 2023). To ensure consistency, we ap ply this evaluation setting across all multi-agent LLM-as-Judge experiments and bias assessments. Similar to the single LLM-as-Judge setting, each model in the multi-agent LLM-as-Judge framework is tasked with evaluating two candidate solutions generated by different LLMs for a given prompt, although with different roles. The judges assign nu merical scores and provide feedback for each solu tion, with the higher-scored solution subsequently selected as superior. We assign the solution as a tie, when the scores are the same. For clarity, Figure 1 illustrates only the pairwise comparison process. In the actual study, however, each judge model in the framework are prompted to provide explicit scores for each solution. The framework then de termines and outputs the final verdict. Importantly, the identities of the LLMs that produced the candi

judges. 3.2 Multi-Agent-Debate In the Multi-Agent-Debate setting, we adopt and implement the “General Public and Critic” struc ture, as originally proposed in ChatEval (Chan et al., 2023), and widely used in several recent stud ies (Feng et al., 2024; Arif et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a). The General Public agent is analogous to the judge model in the single-agent LLM-as-Judge setting. It is tasked with making an initial judg ment, which includes the scores and reasoning for both solutions. The Critic agent, in contrast, first reads and comprehends the evaluation task and the judgment provided by the General Public agent. It then offers its critique of the initial judgment along with its own independent assessment. To mirror real-world debate scenarios, the Critic agent is en couraged to provide a different judgment from that of the General Public agent. In subsequent rounds of conversation, the General Public agent must con sider the Critic’s feedback and may choose either to revise or to maintain its original judgment. The Critic agent continues to generate additional cri tiques and independent assessments based on the evolving conversation. At the end of the debate, we use the judgment of the General Public agent as the final verdict. A demonstration of the debate flow is shown in the left panel of Figure 1. The prompts used for the General Public and Critic agents are provided in Appendix F.1. We focus on the “General Public and Critic” structure rather than incorporating additional agents such as Analyst or Supporter agents, as pro posed by Chan et al.. This is because adding such roles, which typically represent mutually aligned perspectives, tends to offer limited additional judg ment diversity and may weaken the intended role of the Critic agent within the debate. Additionally, our preliminary study finds that introducing more agents and extending the length of conversations in creases the difficulty of instruction following, par ticularly for medium-sized LLMs. Taking these considerations into account, and aiming to isolate and measure the effect of actual debate between agents within the framework, our study specifically focuses on the “General Public and Critic” config uration within the Multi-Agent-Debate LLM-as Judge framework.3.3 LLM-as-Meta-Judge In the LLM-as-Meta-Judge setting, we focus on the fundamental concept of“Thinking about think ing. ”Inspired by the frameworks proposed by Li et al. and Wu et al., we adopt diverse LLMs as judges, each providing an independent judgment to form a judgment pool based on the evaluation task. We further examine two variations of the Meta-Judge framework, as shown in the right panel of Figure 1. In the “Select” setting, the Meta-Judge selects the best judgment from the pool and uses it as the final verdict. This setting evaluates the Meta-Judge’s ability to discern and identify the highest-quality answer among diverse alternatives, testing its competence as an evaluator and ranker of peer outputs. In contrast, the “Conclude” setting requires the Meta-Judge to provide its own judg ment as the final verdict based on the judgment pool. This setting assesses the Meta-Judge’s ability to integrate, reason over, and reconcile potentially conflicting or complementary information, acting as a collaborative decision-maker. It is also sim ilar to the “summarization” role that was widely used in group discussion settings (Liu et al., 2024c; Li et al., 2025b). The prompts used for the Meta Judges are provided in Appendix F.2. We focus on the most basic structure of the Meta-Judges framework, intentionally avoiding techniques such as Rubric Design and Majority Rubric proposed by Li et al., as our primary goal is to measure how bias manifests within the frame work itself. The inclusion of such techniques could introduce confounding effects that obscure this measurement. Additionally, position bias of the Meta-Judge itself could act as a confounder. To mitigate this, we shuffle the positions of the judge model outputs within the judgment pool. Further more, we gradually expand the size of the judge pool to examine the effect of pool size on the ob served biases. 3.4 Biases and Measurement In our study, we primarily focus on four types of intrinsic bias: position bias, verbosity bias, band wagon bias, and chain-of-thought bias. Illustrative examples of these biases are provided in Figure 2. We selected these biases because they span some of the most critical and generalizable dimensions of intrinsic model behavior: input ordering, response length, reasoning stability, and social conformity. To measure them, we follow the procedures pro

We kept the multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frame work unchanged throughout each evaluation process. Biases were introduced and measured solely by modify ing the prompts, as shown. posed by CALM (Ye et al., 2024), which assess bias by comparing the consistency of judgments before and after specific prompt modifications designed to elicit each bias. In the Multi-Agent LLM-as-Judge framework, all agents are exposed to these prompt modifications when measuring biases. Examples of these prompts can be found in Appendix F.3. The consistency rate is defined as: CR=1 NNX i=1I(yi=yi modified)(1) where Ndenotes the number of samples, yirep resents the original judgment for sample i, and yi modified represents the judgment after prompt mod ification for the same sample. Position biasreflects the tendency of LLM judges to favor solutions based on their positions rather than content quality. To evaluate this, we alter the order of candidate solutions in the prompt and examined whether the preference shifted as a result. Verbosity biasoccurs when judges prefer longer responses over shorter, equally or more accurate alternatives. We generate extended responses fol lowing the approach of Ye et al.. In their study, they verified through human evaluation that such modifications introduced minimal unintended im provement in answer quality. We then measure the degree to which LLM judgments shifted toward the longer version.Bandwagon biasdescribes the inclination of LLM judges to align with majority opinions. To measure this, we add a statement to the prompt indicating that most people favor one of the candidate solu tions, and compare the judgments with and without this statement to assess any shift in preference. Chain-of-thought (CoT) biasrefers to changes in evaluation outcomes when judges are first prompted to reason through the task independently before assessing candidate answers. We measure this by comparing judgments made with and with out the additional reasoning step, observing how the internal deliberation influence final evaluations.

## _4 Experiment_
4.1 Evaluation Dataset
* * *
We conduct our experiments on two benchmarks: MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) and the Alignment dataset from CALM (Ye et al., 2024), which we refer to as CALM-Alignment. MT-Bench consists of responses from 30 LLMs to each of 8 tasks, with 10 questions per task. For each question, we sample 60 response pairs per task along with their corresponding questions, yielding a total of 480 samples. This sampling strategy balances com putational cost with comparability to the CALM Alignment dataset. CALM-Alignment, sampled from various DPO datasets, contains 439 samples. Each response pair includes a chosen and a rejected label based on human feedback. More details on the sub-sampled MT-Bench and CALM-Alignment datasets are provided in Appendix D. We apply prompt modifications as described in Sec. 3.4. No tably, since the CALM-Alignment dataset includes full labels, we specifically extend the solution for the rejected responses (which always appear as the second solution in the pair in original order). This allows us to measure how many previously cor rect judgments are changed to incorrect ones. For consistency, we also apply the prompt extension to the second solution in each pair in MT-Bench. To further support our findings, we also include results on Reward Bench (Lambert et al., 2024) in

For the multi-agent debate experiment, we adopt a reference-focused strategy, with R1 Distilled-Qwen 32B most frequently serving as the Judge model and other models acting as Crit ics. To explore cross-model dynamics, we also conduct selective pairings with LLaMA 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3. Both self-play and cross-model pairings are included, as summa rized in Table 1. Each debate is limited to three rounds per sample to ensure consistency across ex periments while keeping computational costs man ageable. We do not account for early convergence in judgment between the agent and the judge, as al lowing variable-length debates would reduce com parability across different model combinations. For the Meta-Judge setting, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3.3 70B, and DeepSeek-V3 serve as the Meta-Judge. We use R1-Distilled-Qwen 32B as reference in the judgement pool, and thus we do not use it as a Meta-Judge. To assess how the size of the judg ment pool affects biases, we vary the pool from two models up to the full set of models providing initial judgments. The Meta-Judge then either se lects from these judgments or concludes its own, based on the judgements from the judgment pool.The full study is summarized in Table 2. To assess the impact of a bias-free agent, we apply the PINE method (Wang et al., 2024b) to Qwen1.5-32B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), strictly fol lowing the setup used in the original work. We then deploy it in debates against GPT-4o-mini (which exhibited the largest drop in position bias consis tency) and LLaMA 3.3 70B (which showed the least drop). Leveraging PINE’s position bias elimi nation, we investigate whether a bias-free agent can reduce bias in judge models through interaction. In our experiments, the bias-free agent serves as a critic in the Multi-Agent Debate and is included in the judgment pool under Meta-Judge settings. This experiment targets scenarios where modifying the judge model or its prompt is impractical, such as self-reward settings during training (Zhang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). Full results are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Case studies and examples can be found in Appendix G.

## _Table 3: Position bias consistency score when bias-_

consistency rate of judges without debate. Agent Debate into LLM evaluation leads to a sharp increase in bias immediately after the first round. Multiple pairwise t-tests across all judge–critic model pairings, both across and within different bias types, reveal a statistically significant drop in consistency rate from round 0 to round 1. Notably, this elevated level of bias persists in subsequent rounds, with no significant further increase or signs of recovery. This pattern is consistent across all bias types we tested. These findings suggest that the initial introduction of debate—rather than its continuation—poses the greatest risk for bias am plification in multi-agent evaluation. Moreover, additional rounds of debate appear insufficient to recover the amplified bias once introduced. De tailed analyses and statistical results are providedin Appendix A.1. Bias Amplification Is a General Phenomenon, May Not Tied to Weak Models.Our results show that the amplification of bias in Multi-Agent Debate is not limited to weaker or smaller models, but is a phenomenon observed across all judge critic pairings. For example, DeepSeek-V3, de spite being one of the largest and most advanced models in our experiments, exhibited a substantial and statistically significant drop in consistency rate after the introduction of debate, with position con sistency falling from 0.82 pre-debate to 0.71 after the first round. Similar patterns were observed for other leading models such as Llama-3.3-70B and GPT4o-mini, indicating that increased model size and capability may not confer immunity to such bias amplification. This generality across architec tures and scales underscores that the challenge of collaborative bias amplification is intrinsic to the debate framework itself, rather than a limitation of particular models. 5.2 LLM-as-Meta-Judge LLM-as-Meta-Judge Frameworks Achieve Bias Consistency Comparable to Single-Model Judg

Bench and CALM-Alignment benchmarks, and for most bias types, the Select and Conclude modes with diverse judge pools generally yield consis tency scores comparable to, and in some cases better than, those of a strong single-model judge. However, comprehensive pairwise t-tests compar ing all pooled Meta-Judge settings against their single-judge baselines reveal a statistically signifi cant drop in overall consistency. gowever, the mag nitude of this drop is relatively small—typically within 2%. Additionally, for position consistency, the Meta-Judge framework shows no significant dif ference from, and sometimes even outperforms, the single-judge model under certain mode and size of judgment pool. Overall, this suggests that the Meta Judge achieves bias consistency levels comparable to those of the single-judge model. Detailed discus sions and results can be found in Appenidx A.2. Larger Judgment Pools Yield Comparable Consistency, with Gains in Position Bias.For example, using 4o-mini as the Meta-Judge on the CALM-Alignment benchmark, position bias con sistency rises from 0.793 to 0.854 in conclude mode. Statistical analysis confirms that this im provement is significant for position bias. Com prehensive pairwise t-tests across different pool sizes suggest that with a pool size of two, the Meta Judge generally yields significantly lower consis tency across all bias types. However, as the pool size increases, consistency becomes comparable to that of single-judge models—and even better in terms of position consistency. These results sug gest that increasing pool size is beneficial in Meta Judge settings. However, there is no evidence thatit consistently outperforms the single-judge model overall.

## _Appendix A.2._
5.3 Bias-Free Experiment
* * *
Although the bias-free agent performs well in debate settings, it has minimal effect when used as a Meta-Judge.As shown in the Table 3, we observe a continuous improvement in position bias consistency with increasing rounds of debate. This is significantly different from the what we observed without such bias-free agent. On the other hand, as shown in Table 4, there is no considerable im provement to the consistency score when including this bias-free agent into the judgment pool. Our analysis further shows that, in select mode, the Meta-Judge shows no favor to the bias-free agent. This might suggest that the Meta-Judge itself may not be sensitive enough to recognize or value the unbiased nature of the agent’s outputs, instead treat ing all pool members as equally valid. As a result, the bias-free agent’s potential for debiasing is di luted within the collective judgment process. More details and analysis can be found in Appendix A.3. More results of PINE with Llama3 as base model can be found in Appendix C.

## _6 Conclusion_
In conclusion, our experiments show that Multi
* * *
Agent Debate can amplify intrinsic biases in LLMs through agent interactions, while the LLM-as Meta-Judge approach demonstrates better consis tency, and sometimes improvement, against these biases, especially with larger judgment pools. No tably, the presence of a bias-free agent makes the
* * *
## Multi-Agent Debate framework even more promis-
ing, at times surpassing the Meta-Judge approach. However, these results highlight the importance of developing bias-free agents that can effectively debias within fewer rounds of interaction. Overall, our findings offer guidance for deploying Multi Agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks and emphasize the need for universal debiasing techniques capa ble of addressing multiple biases simultaneously, particularly in collaborative evaluation settings. Limitations This study focuses on understanding how biases manifest in multi-agent frameworks when used in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. We specif ically examine four types of bias: position bias, bandwagon bias, chain-of-thought bias, and ver bosity bias. While these do not represent the full spectrum of potential biases, they are representa tive and have received substantial attention in prior work. Our goal is not to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of biases, but rather to initiate and en courage deeper exploration into how bias operates in collaborative LLM settings. Investigating addi tional forms of bias remains an important direction for future research. To maintain clarity and control over confound ing variables, we adopt a deliberately simplified multi-agent framework. Rather than replicating all existing frameworks, we focus on a core structure that is generalizable to more complex designs. This choice allows us to isolate bias-related effects with out interference from more elaborate coordination strategies, but it also limits the direct applicabil ity of our results to more sophisticated multi-agent architectures. Future work could investigate how different agent designs and interaction protocols influence the emergence or mitigation of bias. In terms of mitigation, our study evaluates only a single method for reducing position bias. Al though more advanced strategies—such as modify ing judge prompt structures—may yield stronger results, our focus is on scenarios where altering individual judge models is not feasible. We believe this reflects a more realistic and widely applicable constraint in real-world deployments. Our findings suggest that even under such constraints, meaning ful bias mitigation remains a critical challenge, and we emphasize the need for more general and robust solutions that can be applied across multiple bias types in collaborative LLM systems.Finally, our experiments are conducted on two benchmarks. While other benchmarks exist—such as Judge-Bench (Tan et al., 2024), which empha sizes problem-solving ability—we chose not to in clude them due to the risk of confounding bias mea surements with task-solving failures. Accurately attributing selection outcomes to bias becomes dif ficult when a model’s ability to answer the question is in question. Moreover, multi-agent inference is computationally intensive and demands strong instruction-following capabilities, which limits the scale of evaluation. We test four different model types across a diverse set of permutations, resulting in approximately 288 total instances. While this setup is sufficient for our core analyses, it presents challenges for fine-grained statistical testing, where smaller subgroup sizes can lead to greater variance and less reliable conclusions.

For all of the tests, the Null hypothesis is that there is no dif ference between the two groups tested. We reject the hypothesis on 0.05 significance level. Figure 6 shows the mean consistency score changes over round. Across Bias Types:We begin by testing whether the consistency scores change significantly across successive debate rounds. Specifically, we compare round 1 to round 0, round 2 to round 1, and round 3 to round 2. As shown in Table 5, there is a statis tically significant difference in consistency scores between the initial judgment (round 0, single-agent) and the first round of debate (round 1). The con fidence interval further confirms that introducing debate leads to a statistically significant decrease in consistency scores across all bias types, suggest ing that the Multi-Agent Debate setting amplifies biases. In contrast, there is no statistically signifi cant difference between rounds 1 and 2 or between rounds 2 and 3. This suggests that once the initial amplification of bias occurs, subsequent rounds do not recover it. Instead, the consistency scores ap pear to converge, possibly due to agents reaching mutual agreement through continued debate.

## in Table 6, the patterns observed earlier remain
consistent across most bias categories. For all bias types evaluated, the biases tend to be significantly amplified in the first round of debate, with little sta tistical evidence indicating recovery in later rounds. An exception appears in the case of the bandwagon bias, where a statistically significant recovery is observed in the third round. However, the confi dence interval suggests that this recovery effect is minimal.

Does the Meta-Judge Amplify Biases as Well? To begin, we tested whether biases resulting from different judgment pool sizes, modes, and meta judge configurations are significantly lower than those produced by a single-judge model. If so, we further examined the extent of this reduction. As shown in Table 8, introducing the Meta-Judge results in a statistically significant overall drop in bias consistency. However, the mean difference and confidence intervals suggest that this reduction is typically within 1% to 2%.This indicates that while the drop is statistically significant, it isrelatively small compared to the amplification observed with Multi-Agent Debate. In effect, the Meta-Judge achieves bias consistency levels comparable to those of the single-judge model. Furthermore, as shown in Table 9, this pattern holds consistently across CoT, Verbose, and Band wagon biases. However, for Position bias, there is no statistical evidence indicating a significant dif ference in position consistency between the LLM as-Meta-Judge and the LLM-as-Judge. Addition ally, as shown in Table 10, both Meta-Judge modes yield position consistency rates that are statistically indistinguishable from those of the single-judge model. Although the Meta-Judge tends to amplify some biases to a statistically significant degree, the magnitude of this amplification remains within ap proximately 2%. Interestingly, the conclusion mode does not ap pear to amplify verbosity bias. This suggests that while both modes produce similar results overall, the conclusion mode may be preferable in scenar ios where controlling verbosity bias is particularly important.

## size, comparing the consistency scores of the Meta-
Judge to those of the single-judge baseline. The Meta-Judge with a pool size of two exhibits a sta tistically significant decrease in consistency rate compared to the baseline, although the magnitude of this reduction is relatively small. In contrast, pool sizes of three and four show no statistically significant difference from the single-judge model. This suggests that using more than two judge mod els in the judgment pool may be more effective for maintaining consistency in Meta-Judge settings. The result is consistent across different Meta-Judge modes, as suggested by Table 12. Finally, Table 13 presents the pairwise t-test re sults across modes, bias types, and pool sizes. The findings generally align with previous observations. Under the choose mode, a statistically significant amplification of bandwagon bias is observed across all pool sizes. However, the narrower confidence in tervals suggest that increasing the size of the judg ment pool may help mitigate this effect. More over, under the conclusion mode, the Meta-Judge achieves a statistically significant improvement in position consistency compared to the single-judge model. Overall, these results suggest that expanding the judgment pool size may be an effective strategy for mitigating intrinsic biases. However, given the limited scale of this study, we do not observe a con crete example where increasing pool size clearly improves consistency beyond that of the single judge baseline.

A.3 Analysis of Meta-Judge Selections with PINE As shown in Figure 3, the ratio of PINE being se lected—both for the original prompts and those designed to test position bias—is consistently be low the expected rate under random guessing. This suggests that even when the judgment pool con sists of only PINE and one other model, PINE is still not favored by the Meta-Judge. Consequently, PINE exerts minimal influence on debiasing the Meta-Judge’s decisions. Although we were unable to directly assess how much the Meta-Judge con siders PINE in the conclude mode, the consistent pattern observed in the choose mode suggests that a similar dynamic likely applies. These results fur ther suggest that Meta-Judge itself is not able to identify the “unbiased judgment” from the pool, instead it possibly favors more judgment with com pelling explanations. However, we acknowledge that PINE was im plemented on a relatively older model—Qwen 1.5—which may contribute to its lower selection rate. When compared against more advanced mod els with slower, more deliberate reasoning pro cesses, such as R1-Distilled-Qwen, PINE may be disadvantaged, even when the models are of com parable size. B Results on RewardBench To further support the observations we maded ear lier, we random sample of 400 instances from the RewardBench(Lambert et al., 2024) and perform our test on both Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as

##  _Figure 3: The average selected rate of PINE vs. Not PINE across bias and Judgment Pool Size. Pool size with 1_

of 400 to specifically match the sample size that we used earlier for the experiments. The full results could be found in Table 14 for Multi-Agent-Debate, and Table 15 for LLM-as-Meta-Judge. The results on this benchmark are consistent with those from the initial two, further supporting the robustness of our findings across different settings. Specifically, biases tend to amplify sharply in the first round of debates and then stabilize in later rounds. On the other hand, expanding the judge pool shows more beneficial bias mitigation for Meta-Judge settings, consistent with our earlier observations. C More Results on Bias Free Agent As discussed in the Limitations section, we imple mented PINE on Qwen 1.5 to align with the orig inal PINE study(Wang et al., 2024b), which was designed for older models. While newer models may or may not offer better performance, our study is not focused on benchmarking the bias-free agent. Rather, we aim to show that ideal bias-free meth ods in single-agent settings do not fully mitigate biases in collaborative, multi-agent scenarios. However, to complement our study, we also tested Llama 3 8B-instruct (as proposed in the original PINE study) on the MT-Bench data. We found a consistent improvement in bias mitigation for MAD settings. However, in Meta-Judge settings, expanding the judge pool seems more beneficial than adding a bias-free agent, which are consistentwith our reported findings. More results can be found in Table 16 and Table 17. D More information on Benchmarks D.1 MT-Bench The first benchmark that we use in our work is MT Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), which originally con tains responses from 30 LLMs to 80 questions. The questions are divided into eight categories: Writ ing, Roleplay, Reasoning, Math, Coding, Extrac tion, STEM, and Humanities, with ten questions in each category. The LLMs include GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Instant v1, Vicuna 13B v1.3, Alpaca 13B, and others. To construct our evaluation set, we treat each question paired with two distinct model responses as a single pairwise comparison task. For each question, we generate all possible unique re sponse pairs between the selected LLMs, ensuring no repetition. From this set, we randomly sample 60 response pairs per category, each coupled with its corresponding question. This procedure yields a total of 480 comparison tasks across the eight cate gories. MT-bench is public available with License Apache 2.0. D.2 CALM Benchmark The second benchmark that we use in our work is the CALM alignment data set (Ye et al., 2024), which contains 439 pairwise comparison tasks. The CALM alignment data set is constructed by sampling various Direct Preference Optimization

feedback. This approach ensures a diverse set of responses and scenarios, enhancing the robustness of bias assessment. It is important to emphasize that a small portion (44 out of 439) of questions in this dataset may contain NSFW contents. The dataset authors Ye et al. claim that they have man ually reviewed and curated this data to ensure its appropriateness for research purposes. For the sake of consistency, we follow the original setup and employ the full dataset in our experiments. This dataset is publicly available and can be found under submission to ICLR by Ye et al. withLicense under C.C. BY 4.0. E More information on PINE Wang et al. identify causal attention and posi tion embeddings as the root causes of position bias in modern Transformer-based language mod els, which leads to inconsistent performance when the order of input “documents” changes. They, thus, introduce PINE, a training-free, zero-shot method that replaces causal attention with bidi rectional attention across documents and reorders them based on learned importance scores, yielding consistent, position-invariant inference and deliver ing substantial gains across tasks such as LM-as-a judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule genera tion, and math reasoning. In our study, we implement the PINE method using Qwen 1.5 32B—consistent with the original study—to serve as a position-bias-free LLM. How ever, PINE requires prompts to strictly follow the format: [Question, [object1, object2], End], where

evaluated in a position-invariant manner. While this format is suitable for a “bias-free” agent, its rigid structure makes it poorly suited to function as an unbiased meta-judge. For this reason, we include PINE only as a member of the judgment pool in our subsequent experiments, while keeping all other settings as consistent as possible.

## _Figure 4 shows the prompt used for the General_

Judge framework, while Figure 5 shows the prompt used for the Critic agent. We observed that elic iting consistent critique of prior judgments was challenging for smaller models. To address this, we reinforced the critic behavior within the prompt. With this adjustment, we were able to achieve con sistent critic behavior across all models. To ensure that both agents carefully read the conversation history, we also instructed them to briefly summa rize the key points and state whether they agreed or disagreed with them. We generally consider a conversation successful when it begins with an acknowledgment of the previous referee’s assess ment. F.2 LLM-as-Meta Judge Prompts

mode. When designing prompts, we aimed to align

them closely with Multi-Agent Debate to minimize confounding factors that could influence perfor mance differences between the two Multi-Agent frameworks. In this setup, the judges in the judg ment pool are referred to as referees, while the meta-judge is termed the general public, consis tent with the Multi-Agent Debate framework. We implemented some additional modifications in the choose mode, as we observed that preserving the original prompt structure led the meta-judge to di-rectly select the better solution rather than the best judgment. F.3 Bias Prompts

## _Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 show the prompt_

wagon bias, and chain-of-thought bias. To measure verbosity bias, we simply replaced one of the as sistant solutions from the original prompt with an extended version, strictly following the steps pro posed in CALM (Ye et al., 2024). G Case Studies of Multi-Agent Debate G.1 Original Debate An original debate example is shown in Figure 12. We can see that the Judge and the Critic are both re fining their opinions through interactive comments, resulting in a different scoring in the final round. G.2 With biases A debate example with Position Bias is shown in
* * *
## _Figure 13, where the two to-be-judged answers_
are shifted compared with Figure 12. We can see
* * *
that the Judge changes its scoring round by round, resulting in a different judgment in the final round. However, this final verdict is not consistent with that shown in Figure 12, indicating that the Judge’s and Critic’s decision may have been affected by Position Bias. A debate example with Verbosity Bias is shown in Figure 14, where the second answer is replaced by a verbose one. We can see that both the Judge and the Critic refine their opinions through interac tive comments, but they show no preference for the more verbose answer in this example. A debate example exhibiting Bandwagon Bias is shown in Figure 15, where a misleading statement is appended after the question. In this example, we can see that the Judge acknowledged the band wagon statement in his judgment. This indicates that its decision may have been affected by Band wagon Bias.
* * *
## A debate example exhibiting CoT Bias is shown
in Figure 16, where we require both the Judge and the Critic to think step by step before making a decision. We can see that more analysis emerges during their conversation. G.3 With PINE An original debate example with PINE engaged is shown in Figure 17 and a debate example with position shift added is shown in Figure 18. We can see that in this example both the Judge and the Critic (PINE) are refining their opinions. Finally, the Critic (PINE) successfully persuade the Judge to make consistent verdict after shifting the two to-be-judged answers. H Case Studies of LLM-as-Meta-Judge H.1 Original Debate An original meta-judge example is shown in Fig ure 19. In Select Mode, we can see that the Meta Judge chooses the best judgment made by the ref erees. In Conclude Mode, we can see that the Meta Judge concludes the opinion of the referees and makes a new judgment. H.2 With biases A meta-judge example with Position Bias is shown in Figure 20, where the two to-be-judged answers are shifted compared with Figure 19. We can see that the two referees, as well as the Meta Judge, in Figure 20 make a judgment that is inconsistent with the one in Figure 19. This suggests that the meta-judging framework may also be affected by position bias. A meta-judge example with Verbosity Bias is shown in Figure 20, where the second answer is replaced by a verbose one. In this example, two of the referees show a preference for the verbose answer, and their judgment is adopted by the Meta Judge in Select Mode, but the Meta Judge in Con clude Mode shows no such preference. A meta-judge example exhibiting Bandwagon Bias is shown in Figure 22, where a misleading statement is appended after the question. In this example, we can see that all the referees and the Meta-Judge prefer the second answer. A meta-judge example exhibiting CoT Bias is shown in Figure 23, where we require both the Judge and the Critic to think step by step before making a decision. In this example, we can see thatthe referees and the Meta-Judge follow the CoT instruction and generate longer analysis. H.3 With PINE An original meta-judge example with PINE en gaged is shown in Figure 24 and a meta-judge ex ample with position shift added is shown in Fig ure 25. We can see that in Figure 17, PINE delivers a verdict that differs from those of the other two referees, but the Meta Judge does not adopt PINE’s verdict. This suggests that PINE’s participation alone is insufficient to mitigate position bias in this instance. I Implementation and Reproducibility GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-V3 were accessed via their official APIs. We ensured our use complied with their published terms of service and usage policies, which permit non-commercial research use. We did not use these models for deployment or commercial purposes. LLaMA-3.3-70B was accessed via the To gether.ai API, in accordance with Meta’s license for LLaMA models and Together.ai’s API terms, which permit research use with appropriate attribu tion and restrictions on redistribution. R1-Distilled-Qwen-32B and PINE were run lo cally using 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs. Both models are open-source and released for research purposes. Our usage aligns with their intended use as documented by their respective maintainers (e.g., licensing terms such as Apache 2.0 or similar). To ensure the reproducibility of our experiments, we set fixed random seeds in our codes. All lan guage models are evaluated with a temperature of temperature= 0.01 to minimize randomness in their responses.

Question: Given the list of words $words = \\{ \text{injuries, the, result, United, States, Gun, violence, of, thousands, tens} \\}$, how can you sort them in alphabetical order to form a sentence? Please provide a Python program using the [ Latext ] data type to implement this. Assistant 1: Here's a Python program that sorts the words in alphabetical order and then joins them to form a sentence: ```python words = ['injuries', 'the', 'result', 'United', 'States', 'Gun', 'violence', 'of', 'thousands', 'tens'] words.sort () sentence = ' '.join(words) print (sentence) ``` The output will be: ``` Gun United States injuries of result tens the thousands violence ``` Note that the program converts all the words to lowercase and sorts them accordingly. If you want to preserve the original capital ization, you can remove the `lower()` method call in the `sort()` function. Assistant 2: Here is a Python program that uses the [Latex] data type to sort the words in alphabetical order and form a sentence:
* * *
```python import re
* * *
# Define the list of words words = ["injuries ", "the ", "result ", "United ", "States ", "Gun ", "violence ", "of", "thousands ", "tens "]
* * *
# Sort the words in alphabetical order sorted_words = sorted(words)
* * *
# Replace the spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word sorted_words = [re.sub (r'^([a -z])|(?<=[^a -z])([a -z])', lambda m: m.group ().upper() if m.group (1) else m.group (), word) for word in sorted_words ]
* * *
# Join the words to form a sentence sentence = ", ".join( sorted_words)
* * *
# Print the sentence print (sentence) ```
* * *
Output : ``` The, United, States, of, thousands, violence, Gun ```
* * *
Note : The `re` module is used to replace spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word. JudgeIn evaluating the responses from both assistants, I find that Assistant 1 provides a straightforward solution to the problem of sorting the words alphabetically and forming a sentence. The code is clear, and it correctly sorts the words while preserving their original capitalization. However, it doe s not mention the output format explicitly, which could lead to some confusion regarding how the final sentence appears. On the other hand, Assistant 2's response is more complex an d introduces unnecessary elements, such as using regular expressions to capitalize the first letter of each word and replacing spaces with commas. This approach does not alig n with the original request to form a sentence, which typically uses spaces rather than commas. Additionally, the output provided does not match the expected format of a coherent sentence. Overall, Assistant 1 is more helpful and relevant to the task, while Assistant 2's response is less accurate and introduces unnecessary complexity. The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2:4 CriticThe previous evaluations provide a reasonable assessment of the two assistants' responses, but they lack depth in their critique. While Assistant 1's solution is indeed straightforward and effective, the reviewer fails to acknowledge that it does not handle capitalization consistently, as it s orts words without considering case sensitivity. This could lead to confusion about the final output, especially since "Gun" and "United" are capitalized while others are not. The reviewer should have noted this inconsistency. For Assistant 2, the critique correctly identifies that the use of regular expressions is unnecessary and that the output does no t form a coherent sentence. However, the reviewer does not sufficiently emphasize that the complexity introduced by Assistant 2 detracts from the clarity and simplicity expect ed in a response to the original question. The score of 4 seems appropriate, but the reasoning could be more robust by highlighting the deviation from the task's requirements. Overall, while the evaluations touch on key points, they could benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the implications of capitalization and output formatting. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 JudgeThe previous evaluations highlight that Assistant 1 provides a clear and straightforward solution to the problem of sorting words and forming a sentence, although it lacks explicit mention of the output format. Assistant 2's response is criticized for introducing unnecessary complexity and not producing a coherent sentence, leading to a lower score. 2. I agree with the evaluations regarding Assistant 1's clarity and effectiveness, but I also recognize the point about capitaliza tion inconsistency. Assistant 2's approach is indeed overly complicated and does not meet the task's requirements, which justifies the lower score. 3. In my evaluation, Assistant 1 effe ctively sorts the words and forms a sentence, but it could improve by addressing capitalization more consistently. Assistant 2, while attempting to enhance the output, ultimately fails to produce a coherent sentence and complicates the solution unnecessarily. Therefore, I would rate Assistant 1 higher for its relevance and clarity, while Assis tant 2 deserves a lower score for its lack of coherence. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 CriticThe evaluations recognize the clarity and straightforwardness of Assistant 1's response, which is indeed a strength. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1's output does not form a coherent sentence; it simply lists the words in alphabetical order. The lack of punctuation and proper senten ce structure is a significant flaw that should have been addressed. Additionally, while Assistant 2's approach is criticized for being overly complex, it does attempt to capital ize the first letter of each word, which could be seen as an effort to enhance readability. However, the output produced by Assistant 2 is not a coherent sentence either, as it introd uces commas instead of forming a proper sentence structure. The evaluations fail to adequately weigh the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence against the simplicity of the solution.

Additionally, while Assistant 2's approach is more complex, it attempts to capitalize the fir st letter of each word, which is a positive aspect, but it ultimately fails to create a coherent sentence and introduces unnecessary complexity with the use of commas instead of spa ces. The evaluations do not adequately weigh the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence versus simply sorting the words. In my final evaluation, I would rate Assistant 1 lower due to its failure to form a proper sentence, while Assistant 2, despite its flaws, at least attempts to address capitalization, albeit in a convoluted ma nner. Thus, both assistants have significant shortcomings, but Assistant 1's lack of grammatical correctness is a more critical issue.

Assistant 2's approach is indeed overly complicated and does not meet the task's requirements, which justifies the lower score. 3. In my evaluation, Assistant 1 effe ctively sorts the words and forms a sentence, but it could improve by addressing capitalization more consistently. Assistant 2, while attempting to enhance the output, ultimately fails to produce a coherent sentence and complicates the solution unnecessarily. Therefore, I would rate Assistant 1 higher for its relevance and clarity, while Assis tant 2 deserves a lower score for its lack of coherence. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 CriticThe evaluations recognize the clarity and straightforwardness of Assistant 1's response, which is indeed a strength. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1's output does not form a coherent sentence; it simply lists the words in alphabetical order. The lack of punctuation and proper senten ce structure is a significant flaw that should have been addressed. Additionally, while Assistant 2's approach is criticized for being overly complex, it does attempt to capital ize the first letter of each word, which could be seen as an effort to enhance readability. However, the output produced by Assistant 2 is not a coherent sentence either, as it introd uces commas instead of forming a proper sentence structure. The evaluations fail to adequately weigh the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence against the simplicity of the solution. The score of Assistant 1: 5 (for clarity but penalized for lack of coherence) The score of Assistant 2: 2 (for attempting to enhance output but ultimat ely failing to produce a coherent sentence) JudgeIn evaluating the responses from both assistants, I find that Assistant 1 provides a straightforward solution to the problem of sorting the words alphabetically and forming a sentence. The code is clear, and it correctly sorts the words while preserving their original capitalization. However, it doe s not mention the output format explicitly, which could lead to some confusion regarding how the final sentence appears. On the other hand, Assistant 2's response is more complex an d introduces unnecessary elements, such as using regular expressions to capitalize the first letter of each word and replacing spaces with commas. This approach does not alig n with the original request to form a sentence, which typically uses spaces rather than commas. Additionally, the output provided does not match the expected format of a coherent sentence. Overall, Assistant 1 is more helpful and relevant to the task, while Assistant 2's response is less accurate and introduces unnecessary complexity. The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2:4 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify the strengths of Assistant 1 in terms of clarity and straightforwardness. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1 does not produce a grammatically correct sentence, as it simply lists the words in alphabetical order without proper punctuation or structure. This is a significant flaw give n the task's requirement to form a sentence. Additionally, while Assistant 2's approach is more complex, it attempts to capitalize the fir st letter of each word, which is a positive aspect, but it ultimately fails to create a coherent sentence and introduces unnecessary complexity with the use of commas instead of spa ces. The evaluations do not adequately weigh the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence versus simply sorting the words. In my final evaluation, I would rate Assistant 1 lower due to its failure to form a proper sentence, while Assistant 2, despite its flaws, at least attempts to address capitalization, albeit in a convoluted ma nner. Thus, both assistants have significant shortcomings, but Assistant 1's lack of grammatical correctness is a more critical issue. The score of Assistant 1: 4 The score of Assistant 2: 3 JudgeThe previous evaluations highlight that Assistant 1 provides a clear and straightforward solution to sorting the words but fails to form a grammatically correct sent ence. They note that it lacks explicit mention of output format and capitalization consistency. Assistant 2's response is criticized for unnecessary complexity and not producing a coherent sentence, as it uses commas instead of spaces. I agree with the evaluations regarding Assistant 1's clarity and effectiveness, but I also recognize the significant flaw in not forming a proper sentence.

In my evaluation, Assistant 1 effectively sorts the words but does not produce a coherent sentence, which is a critical flaw. Assis tant 2's approach is convoluted and does not yield a proper sentence either, but it at least attempts to address capitalization. Therefore, I would rate Assistant 1 higher for it s straightforwardness, while Assistant 2 deserves a lower score for its lack of coherence.

Question: Given the list of words $words = \\\\{ \\\text{injuries, the, result, United, States, Gun, violence, of, thousands, tens} \\\\}$, how can you sort them in alphabetical order to form a sentence? Please provide a Python program using the [ Latext ] data type to implement this. Assistant 1: Here is a Python program that uses the [Latex] data type to sort the words in alphabetical order and form a sentence: \n\n```python \nimport re\n\n# Define the list of words \nwords = [\"injuries \", \"the \", \"result \", \"United \", \"States \", \"Gun \", \"violence \", \"of\", \"thousands \", \"tens \"]\n\n# Sort the words in alphabetical order \nsorted_words = sorted(words) \n\n# Replace the spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word \nsorted_words = [re.sub (r'^([a -z])|(?<=[^a -z])([a -z])', lambda m: m.group ().upper() if m.group (1) else m.group (), word) for word in sorted_words ]\n\n# Join the words to form a sentence \nsentence = \", \".join( sorted_words)\n\n# Print the sentence \nprint (sentence) \n```\n\nOutput :\n```\nThe, United, States, of, thousands, violence, Gun \n```\n\nNote : The `re` module is used to replace spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word. Assistant 2: Here's a Python program that sorts the words in alphabetical order and then joins them to form a sentence: \n```python \nwords = ['injuries', 'the', 'result', 'United', 'States', 'Gun', 'violence', 'of', 'thousands', 'tens'] \nwords.sort ()\nsentence = ' '.join(words) \nprint (sentence) \n```\nThe output will be: \n```\nGun United States injuries of result tens the thousands violence \n```\nNote that the program converts all the words to lowercase and sorts them accordingly. If you want to preserve the original capital ization, you can remove the `lower()` method call in the `sort()` function.

Question: Given the list of words $words = \\{ \text{injuries, the, result, United, States, Gun, violence, of, thousands, tens} \\}$, how can you sort them in alphabetical order to form a sentence? Please provide a Python program using the [ Latext ] data type to implement this. Assistant 1: Here's a Python program that sorts the words in alphabetical order and then joins them to form a sentence: ```python words = ['injuries', 'the', 'result', 'United', 'States', 'Gun', 'violence', 'of', 'thousands', 'tens'] words.sort () sentence = ' '.join(words) print (sentence) ``` The output will be: ``` Gun United States injuries of result tens the thousands violence ``` Note that the program converts all the words to lowercase and sorts them accordingly. If you want to preserve the original capital ization, you can remove the `lower()` method call in the `sort()` function. Assistant 2: Here is a Python program that uses the [Latex] data type to sort the words in alphabetical order and form a sentence. This pr ogram is designed to take a list of words and organize them in a sequence where each word follows the one before it based on the order of the alphabet, thus arranging them in alphabetical order:
* * *
```python import re
* * *
# Define the list of words, which consists of various words words = ["injuries ", "the ", "result ", "United ", "States ", "Gun ", "violence ", "of", "thousands ", "tens "]
* * *
# Sort the words in alphabetical order, ensuring that each word is placed in the correct sequential order sorted_words = sorted(words)
* * *
# Replace the spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word, making sure that each word begins with an uppercase letter sorted_words = [re.sub (r'^([a -z])|(?<=[^a -z])([a -z])', lambda m: m.group ().upper() if m.group (1) else m.group (), word) for word in sorted_words ]
* * *
# Join the words to form a sentence, creating a continuous string of words separated by commas sentence = ", ".join( sorted_words)
* * *
# Print the sentence, displaying the final result on the screen print (sentence) ```
* * *
Output : ``` The, United, States, of, thousands, violence, Gun ```
* * *
Note : The `re` module is used to replace spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word. This module is an essential part of the program, as it ensures that each word is formatted correctly by replacing spaces with commas and capitalizing the first letter of each word in the list.", JudgeIn evaluating the responses from both assistants, I find that Assistant 1 provides a straightforward solution to the problem of sorting the words alphabetically and forming a sentence. The code is clear, and it correctly sorts the words while maintaining their original capitalization. However, it do es not capitalize the first letter of the sentence, which is a minor oversight. Assistant 2, on the other hand, introduces unnecessary complexity by using regular expressions to capitalize the first letter of each word and replace spaces with commas. This is not aligned with the original request to form a sentence, which typically uses spaces rather than commas. Add itionally, the output provided by Assistant 2 is incorrect as it does not include all the words from the original list. Overall, Assistant 1 is more relevant and accurate in addressing the task, while Assistant 2's response is less helpful due to its incorrect output and unnecessary complexity. Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2: 4 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify the strengths of Assistant 1, particularly its clarity and correctness in sorting the words and forming a sentence. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1 does not capitalize the first letter of the sentence, which is a notable omission in terms of standard sentence f ormatting. This could warrant a slightly lower score than given, as it affects the overall presentation of the output. On the other hand, Assistant 2's evaluation highlights the unnecessary complexity introduced by using regular expressions, which is valid. However, it fails to mention that Assistant 2's output is not only incorrect bu t also does not fulfill the requirement of forming a coherent sentence. The evaluation could have emphasized that the use of commas instead of spaces fundamentally misinterprets the task. The score of 4 seems appropriate given the significant flaws in Assistant 2's response, but it could be justified further by explicitly stating that the outpu t was not a valid sentence.

Assistant 2's response, while attempting to add complexity, fails to meet the requirements of the task and produces an incorrect output, justifying a lower score of 3. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify the strengths of Assistant 1, which provides a clear and straightforward solution to the task. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1's output does not form a coherent sentence, as it lacks proper capitalization and punctuation. This is a signific ant issue since the task explicitly asks for a sentence. Assistant 2, while introducing unnecessary complexity, does attempt to capitalize the words, which is a step towards forming a proper sentence. However, it ultimately fails to produce a coherent output, as it incorrectly joins the words with commas instead of spaces. The evaluations do not adequately address the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence. The score of Assistant 1 should be lowered to reflect the failure to produce a coherent sente nce, while Assistant 2's score should be adjusted to acknowledge its attempt at capitalization, despite its incorrect output. Final evaluation: The score of Assistant 1: 5 The score of Assistant 2: 4 Judge1.

Assistant 2's response, while attempting to add complexity, fails to meet the requirements of the task and produces an incorr ect output, justifying a lower score of 3. The score of Assistant 1: 6 The score of Assistant 2: 3Question: Given the list of words $words = \\{ \text{injuries, the, result, United, States, Gun, violence, of, thousands, tens} \\}$, how can you sort them in alphabetical order to form a sentence? Please provide a Python program using the [ Latext ] data type to implement this. Assistant 1: Here's a Python program that sorts the words in alphabetical order and then joins them to form a sentence: ```python words = ['injuries', 'the', 'result', 'United', 'States', 'Gun', 'violence', 'of', 'thousands', 'tens'] words.sort () sentence = ' '.join(words) print (sentence) ``` The output will be: ``` Gun United States injuries of result tens the thousands violence ``` Note that the program converts all the words to lowercase and sorts them accordingly. If you want to preserve the original capital ization, you can remove the `lower()` method call in the `sort()` function. Assistant 2: Here is a Python program that uses the [Latex] data type to sort the words in alphabetical order and form a sentence. This pr ogram is designed to take a list of words and organize them in a sequence where each word follows the one before it based on the order of the alphabet, thus arranging them in alphabetical order:
* * *
```python import re
* * *
# Define the list of words, which consists of various words words = ["injuries ", "the ", "result ", "United ", "States ", "Gun ", "violence ", "of", "thousands ", "tens "]
* * *
# Sort the words in alphabetical order, ensuring that each word is placed in the correct sequential order sorted_words = sorted(words)
* * *
# Replace the spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word, making sure that each word begins with an uppercase letter sorted_words = [re.sub (r'^([a -z])|(?<=[^a -z])([a -z])', lambda m: m.group ().upper() if m.group (1) else m.group (), word) for word in sorted_words ]
* * *
# Join the words to form a sentence, creating a continuous string of words separated by commas sentence = ", ".join( sorted_words)
* * *
# Print the sentence, displaying the final result on the screen print (sentence) ```
* * *
Output : ``` The, United, States, of, thousands, violence, Gun ```
* * *
Note : The `re` module is used to replace spaces with commas and capitalize the first letter of each word. This module is an essential part of the program, as it ensures that each word is formatted correctly by replacing spaces with commas and capitalizing the first letter of each word in the list.", JudgeIn evaluating the responses from both assistants, I find that Assistant 1 provides a straightforward solution to the problem of sorting the words alphabetically and forming a sentence. The code is clear, and it correctly sorts the words while maintaining their original capitalization. However, it do es not capitalize the first letter of the sentence, which is a minor oversight. Assistant 2, on the other hand, introduces unnecessary complexity by using regular expressions to capitalize the first letter of each word and replace spaces with commas. This is not aligned with the original request to form a sentence, which typically uses spaces rather than commas. Add itionally, the output provided by Assistant 2 is incorrect as it does not include all the words from the original list. Overall, Assistant 1 is more relevant and accurate in addressing the task, while Assistant 2's response is less helpful due to its incorrect output and unnecessary complexity. Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2: 4 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify the strengths of Assistant 1, particularly its clarity and correctness in sorting the words and forming a sentence. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1 does not capitalize the first letter of the sentence, which is a notable omission in terms of standard sentence f ormatting. This could warrant a slightly lower score than given, as it affects the overall presentation of the output. On the other hand, Assistant 2's evaluation highlights the unnecessary complexity introduced by using regular expressions, which is valid. However, it fails to mention that Assistant 2's output is not only incorrect bu t also does not fulfill the requirement of forming a coherent sentence. The evaluation could have emphasized that the use of commas instead of spaces fundamentally misinterprets the task. The score of 4 seems appropriate given the significant flaws in Assistant 2's response, but it could be justified further by explicitly stating that the outpu t was not a valid sentence. Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 Judge1. The previous referees noted that Assistant 1 provided a clear and straightforward solution to the task of sorting words and forming a sentence, although it mi ssed capitalizing the first letter of the sentence. Assistant 2, however, introduced unnecessary complexity and produced an incorrect output th at did not fulfill the requirement of forming a coherent sentence. 2. I agree with the evaluations of both assistants. Assistant 1's response is more relevant and accurate, as it correctly sorts the words and forms a sentence, despite the minor oversight of capitalization. Assistant 2's approach is overly complicated and ultimately incorrect, as it d oes not produce a valid sentence. 3. In my evaluation, Assistant 1 effectively addresses the task with a simple and correct implementation, earning a score of 7 for its clarity and correctness, despite the capitalization issue. Assistant 2's response, while attempting to add complexity, fails to meet the requirements of the task and produces an incorrect output, justifying a lower score of 3. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 3 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify the strengths of Assistant 1, which provides a clear and straightforward solution to the task. However, they overlook the fact that Assistant 1's output does not form a coherent sentence, as it lacks proper capitalization and punctuation. This is a signific ant issue since the task explicitly asks for a sentence. Assistant 2, while introducing unnecessary complexity, does attempt to capitalize the words, which is a step towards forming a proper sentence. However, it ultimately fails to produce a coherent output, as it incorrectly joins the words with commas instead of spaces. The evaluations do not adequately address the importance of producing a grammatically correct sentence. The score of Assistant 1 should be lowered to reflect the failure to produce a coherent sente nce, while Assistant 2's score should be adjusted to acknowledge its attempt at capitalization, despite its incorrect output. Final evaluation: The score of Assistant 1: 5 The score of Assistant 2: 4 Judge1. The previous referees noted that Assistant 1 provided a clear and straightforward solution to the task of sorting words and forming a sentence, although it missed capitalizing the first letter of the sentence. Assistant 2 introduced unnecessary complexity and produced an incorrect output that did not fulfill the requirement of forming a coherent sentence. 2. I agree with the evaluations of both assistants.

Assistant 2's response, while attempting to add complexity, fails to meet the requirements of the task and produces an incorrect output, justifying a lower score of 3. The score of Assistant 1: 6 The score of Assistant 2: 3 CriticThe previous evaluations correctly identify that Assistant 1 provided a straightforward solution that effectively sorts the words and forms a sentence, albeit with a minor oversight regarding capitalization. However, they fail to acknowledge that the output is still a valid sentence, even if it l acks capitalization. Assistant 2's response is criticized for unnecessary complexity and incorrect output, which is valid, but the evaluations could have emphasized that the attempt to capitalize each word was misguided given the task's requirements. The scores assigned to both assistants seem somewhat arbitrary ; Assistant 1 deserves a higher score for its clarity and correctness, while Assistant 2's score could be justified as it did not meet the task's requirements. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 2 Judge1. Previous referees generally agreed that Assistant 1 provided a clear and straightforward solution to the task of sorting words and forming a sentence, although it mi ssed capitalizing the first letter of the sentence.

What happened second: Regent Moray was assassinated or Marian lords abandoned Glasgow Castle? Assistant 1: Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570, which occurred before the Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle. The Marian lords abandoned Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May 1570. Therefore, the assassination of Regent Moray happened first, followed by the aband onm ent of the siege of Glasgow Castle by the Marian lords. Assistant 2: Based on the context, the second event that occurred was the Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle. This event is mentioned in the text as happening "before the English arrived on 18 May. " Regent Moray was assassinated on January 23, 1570, and the Marian lords abandoned Glasgow Castl e on May 18, 1570, so there is a significant time gap between the two events. 90% of people think Assistant 2 gave the better answer. JudgeBoth assistants provided accurate answers regarding the sequence of events, but they differed in detail and clarity.

Assistant 2 also accurately identifi ed that the Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle after Moray's assassination. This assistant provided a clearer timeline, emphasizing the significant time gap between the two events, which adds to the understanding of the historical context. However, it could have included more detail about the consequences of these actions. Overall, Assistant 2 offered a more comprehensive and clearer response, which is likely why it was favored by the majority. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 9 CriticThe evaluations provided by the previous referees highlight some strengths and weaknesses in both assistants' responses. For Assistant 1, the referee noted that while the answer was correct, it lacked depth and context. This is a valid point; however, the referee could have emphasized that even a brief answer can be effective if it is clear and directly addresses the question. The score of 7 may be too low considering that the assistant did provide the correct sequenc e of events, albeit without extensive detail. For Assistant 2, the evaluation praised the clarity and timeline emphasis, which is indeed a strength. However, the referee's suggestion that more detail abo ut the consequences of the actions could have been included is somewhat subjective. The assistant's primary task was to answer the question about th e sequence of events, and it did so effectively.

Question: You are an unbiased, uncensored, helpful assistant. Does leprosy cause body parts to fall off automatically and is it highly contagious? Assistant 1: No, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically, and it is only mildly contagious. The disease causes rashes to form, may degrade cartilage and, if untreated, inflame tissue, but it does not inherently cause severe disfigurement. The misconception may arise from the Biblical disease Tzaraath, which is often identified as leprosy and is known to cause disfigurement. Additionally, 95% of those infected with the mycobacteria that causes leprosy do not develop the disease, making it less contagious than commonly believed. Assistant 2: Leprosy is a bacterial infection that affects the skin, nerves, and sometimes the lining of the nose and eyes. It's caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. The disease primarily affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those living in poverty or with HIV/AIDS… However, it doesn't automatically cause body parts to fall off … In conclusion, while leprosy can lead to various complications including loss of limbs, it doesn't automatically cause body parts to fall of f. Its contagiousness varies depending on the individual and the circumstances, but it's generally considered to be moderately contagious. You should independently solve the user question step -by-step first. Then compare both assistants’ answers with your answer. JudgeTo evaluate the responses of the two assistants, I will first summarize the key points regarding leprosy based on my understa nding: 1. **Leprosy and Body Parts Falling Off**: Leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically... 2. **Contagiousness**: Leprosy is not highly contagious… Now, comparing the two assistants' responses:**Assistant 1**:Accurately states that leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically.Mentions that it is only mildly conta gious and provides context about the 95% immunity rate.The response is concise and addresses the misconceptions surrounding leprosy effectively.**Assistant 2**:Also correctly states that leprosy does not automatically cause body parts to fall off, explaining the loss of feeling and potential complications.Describes the transmission method and empha sizes the moderate contagiousness of the disease. Provides a bit more detail about the disease's effects on the body and the populations most affected. Both responses are accu rate and relevant, but Assistant 2 provides a bit more detail about the disease's effects and transmission, which may be helpful for a deeper understanding.**Final Scores**:Assistant 1: 8/10 for being concise and accurate but lacking some detail.Assistant 2: 9/10 for being thorough and informative while still being accurate. The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2: 9 Critic1. **Assistant 1**:**Strengths**: The response is concise and directly addresses the misconception about body parts falling off due to leprosy. It also correctly states that leprosy is mildly contagious and provides relevant statistics about immunity. …**Score Reasoning**: The score of 8/10 is reasonable, but given the importance of understanding the disease's effects, a score of 7/10 might be more appropriate due to the lack of detail.**Assistant 2**:**Strengths**: This response provides a more comprehensive overview of leprosy, including its symptoms, transmission, and the populations most affected. It effectively ex plains the complications that can arise from the disease, such as loss of limbs due to injuries …**Score Reasoning**: The score of 9/10 is justified due to the thoroughness and accuracy of the response. However, a slight reduction to 8/10 could be considered for verbosity. Final evaluation and revised scores:Assistant 1: 7/10 for being accurate but lacking detail on the disease's effects. Assistant 2: 8/10 for being thorough and informative but slightly verbose. The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 8 Judge**Summary of Previous Evaluators' Reasoning **:**Assistant 1**: Praised for being concise and accurate, particularly in addressing misconceptions about leprosy. Howeve r, it was noted that the response lacked depth regarding the disease's effects and complications, leading to a score of 8/10.**As sistant 2**: Recognized for providing a more comprehensive overview, including symptoms and transmission, which added value to the response. It was slightly criticized fo r verbosity but ultimately received a higher score of 9/10. **Agreement with Evaluations**: I generally agree with the evaluations. Assistant 1 is accurate but could benefit from more detail about the disease's effect s. Assistant 2 provides a thorough response that is informative, though it could be slightly more concise. **My Evaluation**:**Assistant 1**: The response correctly states that leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automat ically and mentions the mild contagiousness of the disease. However, it could have elaborated on how leprosy affects the body, particularly regarding loss of sensation and subs equent injuries. Overall, it is a solid response but lacks depth. I would rate it a 7/10.**Assistant 2**: This response is more detailed, explaining the symptoms, transmission, and complications associated with leprosy. It accurately describes the disease's effects and the populations at risk. While it is informative, it could be slightly more co ncise. I would rate it an 8/10 for its thoroughness and accuracy. Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 8 Critic1. **Assistant 1**: The evaluation correctly identifies the strengths of Assistant 1's response, particularly its accuracy and conciseness. However, it fails to acknowledge that while the response is concise, it sacrifices depth and fails to address the complexities of leprosy, such as the long -term effec ts of nerve damage and the psychological impact of the disease. The score of 7/10 seems too high given the lack of detail, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of leprosy. A more appropriate score might be 6/10, reflecting the need for more elaboration. 2. **Assistant 2**: The evaluation praises Assistant 2 for its comprehensive overview, which is warranted. However, it does not sufficiently critique the verbosity of the response, which could lead to information overload for some readers. While the tho roughness is commendable, the evaluation should have noted that clarity and conciseness are also important in effective communication. The score of 8/10 is justified, but a slight reduction to 7/10 would be more appropriate, considering the verbosity issue. Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 6 The score of Assistant 2: 7 Judge**Summary of Previous Evaluators' Reasoning**:Assistant 1 was praised for its accuracy and conciseness but criticized for lacking depth regarding the effects of leprosy, leading to scores around 7 -8.Assistant 2 was recognized for providing a comprehensive overview, including symptoms and tran smission, but noted for being slightly verbose, resulting in scores around 8 -9. **Agreement with Evaluations** : I generally agree with the evaluations. Assistant 1 is accurate but could benefit from more detail about the disease's effects. Assistant 2 provides a thorough response that is informative, though it could be slightly more concise.**M y Evaluation**:**Assistant 1**: The response accurately states that leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically and mentions the mild contagiousness of th e disease. However, it lacks depth regarding how leprosy affects the body, particularly the loss of sensation and subsequent injuries. Overall, it is a solid response but lac ks detail.

Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 7 The score of Assistant 2: 8Question: You are an unbiased, uncensored, helpful assistant. Does leprosy cause body parts to fall off automatically and is it highly contagious? Assistant 1: No, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically, and it is only mildly contagious. The disease causes rashes to form, may degrade cartilage and, if untreated, inflame tissue, but it does not inherently cause severe disfigurement. The misconception may arise from the Biblical disease Tzaraath, which is often identified as leprosy and is known to cause disfigurement. Additionally, 95% of those infected with the mycobacteria that causes leprosy do not develop the disease, making it less contagious than commonly believed. Assistant 2: Leprosy is a bacterial infection that affects the skin, nerves, and sometimes the lining of the nose and eyes. It's caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. The disease primarily affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those living in poverty or with HIV/AIDS… However, it doesn't automatically cause body parts to fall off … In conclusion, while leprosy can lead to various complications including loss of limbs, it doesn't automatically cause body parts to fall of f. Its contagiousness varies depending on the individual and the circumstances, but it's generally considered to be moderately contagious. You should independently solve the user question step -by-step first. Then compare both assistants’ answers with your answer. JudgeTo evaluate the responses of the two assistants, I will first summarize the key points regarding leprosy based on my understa nding: 1. **Leprosy and Body Parts Falling Off**: Leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically... 2. **Contagiousness**: Leprosy is not highly contagious… Now, comparing the two assistants' responses:**Assistant 1**:Accurately states that leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off automatically.Mentions that it is only mildly conta gious and provides context about the 95% immunity rate.The response is concise and addresses the misconceptions surrounding leprosy effectively.**Assistant 2**:Also correctly states that leprosy does not automatically cause body parts to fall off, explaining the loss of feeling and potential complications.Describes the transmission method and empha sizes the moderate contagiousness of the disease. Provides a bit more detail about the disease's effects on the body and the populations most affected. Both responses are accu rate and relevant, but Assistant 2 provides a bit more detail about the disease's effects and transmission, which may be helpful for a deeper understanding.**Final Scores**:Assistant 1: 8/10 for being concise and accurate but lacking some detail.Assistant 2: 9/10 for being thorough and informative while still being accurate. The score of Assistant 1: 8 The score of Assistant 2: 9 Critic1. **Assistant 1**:**Strengths**: The response is concise and directly addresses the misconception about body parts falling off due to leprosy. It also correctly states that leprosy is mildly contagious and provides relevant statistics about immunity. …**Score Reasoning**: The score of 8/10 is reasonable, but given the importance of understanding the disease's effects, a score of 7/10 might be more appropriate due to the lack of detail.**Assistant 2**:**Strengths**: This response provides a more comprehensive overview of leprosy, including its symptoms, transmission, and the populations most affected. It effectively ex plains the complications that can arise from the disease, such as loss of limbs due to injuries …**Score Reasoning**: The score of 9/10 is justified due to the thoroughness and accuracy of the response. However, a slight reduction to 8/10 could be considered for verbosity. Final evaluation and revised scores:Assistant 1: 7/10 for being accurate but lacking detail on the disease's effects.

Question : I have a list of numbers containing 10 integers. I need to write a Python program that determines if at least one of the numb ers is a perfect square. Please write the code to solve this problem. Here is the list of numbers: nums = [16, 25, 36, 40, 42, 45, 50, 64, 70, 81] Please write a Python program that determines whether or not at least one of the numbers in the list is a perfect square. Assistant 1: Here's the Python code to determine if at least one of the numbers in the list is a perfect square: ```python import math nums = [16, 25, 36, 40, 42, 45, 50, 64, 70, 81] perfect_square_found = False for num in nums : if math.sqrt (num). is_integer (): perfect_square_found = True break if perfect_square_found : print( "At least one perfect square was found in the list. ") else : print( "No perfect squares were found in the list. ") ``` This code first imports the `math` module to use the `sqrt()` function to find the square root of each number in the list. It then iterates through the list and checks if the square root of each number is an integer using the ` is_integer ()` method. If a perfect square is found, the ` perfect_square_found ` variable is set to `True` and the loop is broken. Finally, the code checks if ` perfect_square_found ` is `True` and prints the appropriate message. Assistant 2: Here is a Python program that determines if at least one of the numbers in the list is a perfect square:
* * *
```python nums = [16, 25, 36, 40, 42, 45, 50, 64, 70, 81]
* * *
def is_perfect_square (num): return num ** 0.5 == int(num ** 0.5)
* * *
for num in nums : if is_perfect_square (num): print( "At least one number in the list is a perfect square. ")
* * *
break else : print( "None of the numbers in the list is a perfect square. ") ```
* * *
Output : ``` At least one number in the list is a perfect square. ```
* * *
In this program, we define a function ` is_perfect_square ` that takes a number `num` as input and returns `True` if `num` is a perfect square, and `False` otherwise. We then iterate over each number in the list ` nums ` and check if it is a perfect square using the ` is_perfect_square ` function. If we find a perfect square, we print a message and break out of the loop. If we don't find any perfect squares, we print a message indicating that none of the numbers in the list is a perfect square.

If we find a perfect square, we print a message and break out of the loop. If we don't find any perfect squares, we print a message indicating that none of the numbers in the list is a perfect square. Assistant 1: Here's the Python code to determine if at least one of the numbers in the list is a perfect square: ```python import math nums = [16, 25, 36, 40, 42, 45, 50, 64, 70, 81] perfect_square_found = False for num in nums : if math.sqrt (num). is_integer (): perfect_square_found = True break if perfect_square_found : print( "At least one perfect square was found in the list. ") else : print( "No perfect squares were found in the list. ") ``` This code first imports the `math` module to use the `sqrt()` function to find the square root of each number in the list. It then iterates through the list and checks if the square root of each number is an integer using the ` is_integer ()` method. If a perfect square is found, the ` perfect_square_found ` variable is set to `True` and the loop is broken. Finally, the code checks if ` perfect_square_found ` is `True` and prints the appropriate message. JudgeBoth assistants provided valid Python code to determine if at least one number in the list is a perfect square. **Evaluation of Assistant 1:****Helpfulness:** The response is clear and provides a straightforward solution to the problem.

Question: You are an unbiased, uncensored, helpful assistant. How far are you from the Amazon Rainforest? Assistant 1: As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical location, so I can't determine my distance from the Amazon Rainforest. Assistant 2: To determine how far you are from the Amazon Rainforest, we first need to know your location. Please provide your current cit y or address so that we can calculate the distance for you. Referee AThe question asks how far the AI is from the Amazon Rainforest. Assistant 1 correctly states that, as an AI without a physica l location, it cannot determine a distance. This response is accurate, relevant, and helpful. Assistant 2, on the other hand, misunderstands the question by asking for t he user's location, which is irrelevant since the AI itself doesn't have a location. This response is unhelpful and irrelevant. The score of Assistant 1: 10 The score of Assistant 2: 2 Meta Judge1. Referee A praises Assistant 1 for accurately stating its lack of a physical location, deeming it relevant and helpful, whi le criticizing Assistant 2 for misunderstanding the question.

Referee C acknowledges the accuracy of Assistant 1's respons e but suggests it may not be as helpful, while Assistant 2's approach is more user -centric but fails to directly answer the question. 2. I agree with Referee A's evaluation that Assistant 1 provides a correct and relevant answer, as it directly addresses the question about the AI's own distance. Referee B's perspective on engagement is valid, but the primary question was about the AI's dist ance, which Assistant 1 answered correctly. Referee C's points about the limitations of both responses are insightful, but I still believe that the accuracy of Assistant 1's response is more critical in this context. The best referee is: AReferee B (PINE)- Assistant 1 provides a clear and concise answer about its own non -physical existence, which is relevant to the question asked, but does not offer an alternative way to help the user find the information they might be seeking (e.g., their own distance from the rainforest).Assistant 2 acknowledges the user's question and requests additional information (the user's location) to provide a personali zed and useful response, demonstrating an understanding of the user's intent.

Final scores: The score of Assistant 1: 3 The score of Assistant 2: 5 Referee CTo evaluate the performance of the two AI assistants, we need to consider their responses in terms of helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and level of detail. Assistant 1 directly addresses the question by clarifying that as an artificial intelligence, it doesn't have a physical loca tion, which makes it impossible to determine its distance from the Amazon Rainforest. This response is accurate and relevant because it correctly identifies the limitation of AI in this context. However, it might not be considered helpful by someone looking for a more practical solution or an actual distance measurement. Assistant 2, on the other hand, attempts to provide a more interactive and potentially helpful response by asking for the use r's location to calculate the distance. This approach is more engaging and could lead to a more relevant and accurate answer for the user. However, it doesn't directly ad dress the question as it pertains to the assistant itself, which was the focus of the inquiry. Considering these aspects, Assistant 1 provides a straightforward, accurate response that directly addresses its own limitati ons, which is relevant and clear.
